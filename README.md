Valyria Tear is an open-source single-player medieval-fantasy 2D J-RPG based on an extended [Hero of Allacrost](http://www.allacrost.org/) engine and inspired by classic console RPGs.

The player incarnates Bronann, a young boy forced to take part into the struggle for the possession of a mysterious crystal.
This powerful artifact will lead him to discover the actual threat set upon his world, but also courage and love.

The game has all the features you can expect from JRPG classics: entertaining story development, colourful map exploration, active side-view battles, character management, puzzles... It is also translated in several languages.

## Compilation procedure

**Linux compilation**
Once you've unpacked the tarball or checked it out of Git repository,
just run `cmake . && make ` from the top-level directory at the prompt.

You'll then be able to play by typing: `src/valyriatear`

**Windows compilation**
- **Code::Blocks:**

A [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) project file is also provided when compiling under Windows.
In that case, you might need the dependencies and headers files that can be downloaded [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/valyriatear/files/win32-depends/valyriatear-win32-depends-sdl1.2-2012.08.30.zip/download).

- **Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 and later:**

_**(Warning: not officially supported!)**_
Please contact [authenticate](https://github.com/authenticate) for support.
To build on Windows with Visual Studio 2013, do this:
- git clone https://github.com/authenticate/ValyriaTear-VS2013-Dependencies.git
- Copy the ```ValyriaTear-VS2013-Dependencies/``` folder into your Valyria Tear repository.
- Open the VS 2013 solution file: ```ValyriaTearRepository/vs2013/ValyriaTear.sln```
- Build ```F7```
- Run ```F5```

**Mac OS X compilation**
- Use Macports or Homebrew to install things like boost.
- Open Xcode project, tu quickly update the files, delete src folder in project and add it again. Remove all unnecessary things.
- Press "Play"


## Dependencies

You will need the following in order to compile and run the game:

- **Boost headers** (Tested from 1.42 to 1.55)
(make sure that the boost headers used to compile Luabind are the same version used to compile Valyria Tear)
- **GNU Gettext** - (libiconv, libintl)
- **lua** (5.1.x - 5.2.x) - (liblua)
- **Luabind 0.9.1** (Also provided as a static library)
- **libz**
- **libpng** (1.2 to 1.6)
- **Ogg/Vorbis** - (libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisenc, libvorbisfile)
- **OpenAL**
- **OpenGL** and **GLU**
- **SDL** (1.2)
- **SDL_ttf** (1.2)
- **SDL_image** (1.2)

**Map editor only:**
- **Qt 4.8.x** (only if you wish to compile the map editor)

## Map editor or debug feature support compilation

- **Using Cmake:**
Use the `-D` parameter when invoking cmake to add **compilation flags**.

- **Add Editor compilation** (Requires QT 4.8.x headers)
`cmake -DEDITOR_SUPPORT=on .`

- **Add debug menus, and debug commands:**
`cmake -DDEBUG_FEATURES=on .`

- **Add both:**
`cmake -DDEBUG_FEATURES=on -DEDITOR_SUPPORT=on .`

- On **Code::Blocks:**
Go to Project->Build options, and add the flags in the `#defines` tab, i.e.:
`DEBUG_MENU`

Note that the editor can't be built using C::B. Use **Qt-Creator** and the **MapEditor.pro** file for that.
Be sure also to read the instructions within that file, as **RTTI support** must be **enabled**, and **unicode disabled** in the **compile flags**.
